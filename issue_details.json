{"body":"Instead we should add option that is disabled by default to keep previous code if we want it, like `--auto-commit-uncommited-changes`.\n\nAnd now by default we should just use uncommited changes as a feedback line in the main prompt and just do restart claude command if that is the case.\n\nFor example in https://github.com/IvanKirpichnikov/retejo/pull/44 auto commit caused `venv/` folder with 300+ files committed, but there is a strict requirement not to update `.gitignore` file in that repository.\n\nSo if we remove `venv/` from `.gitignore` our solve tool will fail.\nBut if we don't remove it we don't adhere to requirements and pull request will be never merged.\n\nSo as the solution to that contradiction, I think it will be better to let claude command decide what to commit by default.\n","comments":[],"title":"Turn off auto-commit by default of changes by claude if it didn't do it"}
