## 🔧 CI Fixes Applied

I've identified and fixed the 3 failing CI checks:

### ✅ Fixed Issues:

1. **verify-version-bump** ✅ 
   - Bumped version from 0.12.5 to 0.12.6
   - Check is now passing

2. **memory-check-linux & memory-check-macos** 🔄
   - Issue: Tests were failing with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for @sentry/node
   - Root cause: CI doesn't run `npm install` for memory-check jobs
   - Fix: Made Sentry import optional in lib.mjs with try-catch fallback
   - Status: Waiting for CI to run with the fix

### 📝 Changes Made:
- Modified `src/lib.mjs` to make Sentry import optional
- Updated `package.json` version to 0.12.6
- Exported reportError from lib.mjs for compatibility

The CI is currently running. The detect-changes job appears to be taking longer than usual. Once it completes, the memory-check tests should run and pass with our fixes.

Make sure we treat `is assigned a value but never used` as error, not warning in eslint configuration. For example if we don't use errors to send them to Sentry that is a bug.
