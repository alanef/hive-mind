{"baseRefName":"main","body":"## üîß Fix for Issue #224\n\nThis pull request fixes the async iteration error that was causing the hive command to fail for all 5 issues.\n\n### üìã Issue Reference\nFixes #224\n\n### üêõ Problem\nThe error `TypeError: $(...)(...) is not a function or its return value is not async iterable` was occurring when trying to execute Claude commands via command-stream library. The code was attempting to iterate directly over a command object without calling the `.stream()` method.\n\n### ‚úÖ Solution\nFixed the async iteration pattern in `solve.claude-execution.lib.mjs`:\n\n1. **Store command object before iteration**: Split the command creation and iteration into two steps\n2. **Add `.stream()` method**: Call `.stream()` to get an async iterable\n3. **Update chunk property access**: Updated to match command-stream's API:\n   - Changed `chunk.done` to `chunk.type === 'exit'`  \n   - Changed `chunk.stdout` to `chunk.type === 'stdout' ? chunk.data`\n   - Changed `chunk.stderr` to `chunk.type === 'stderr' ? chunk.data`\n\n### üß™ Testing\n- Created test scripts to verify the fix works correctly\n- All existing tests pass successfully\n- The async iteration now properly streams command output\n\n### üìù Changes Made\n- Fixed async iteration in `src/solve.claude-execution.lib.mjs` (lines 79-121)\n- Added test scripts in `experiments/` to validate the fix\n\nThis should resolve all 5 failures mentioned in the issue logs.","commits":[{"authoredDate":"2025-09-19T16:12:08Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"}],"committedDate":"2025-09-19T16:12:08Z","messageBody":"Adding CLAUDE.md with task information for AI processing.\nThis file will be removed when the task is complete.\n\nIssue: https://github.com/deep-assistant/hive-mind/issues/224","messageHeadline":"Initial commit with task details for issue #224","oid":"904cbd69f591aad4313ff5393584b29864076fa4"},{"authoredDate":"2025-09-19T16:17:51Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"}],"committedDate":"2025-09-19T16:17:51Z","messageBody":"The error 'TypeError: $(...)(...) is not a function or its return value is not async iterable'\nwas caused by incorrect usage of the command-stream library's async iteration feature.\n\nChanges made:\n1.
