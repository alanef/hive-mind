* Remove High-Level System Architecture from README.md
* In both README.md and FLOW.md change horizontal order in the sequence diagram. It should be like this: Human - GitHub - Agent - Hive. So GitHub is in the middle.
* Also double check these sequence diagrams correctly represent basic flows in the code.
