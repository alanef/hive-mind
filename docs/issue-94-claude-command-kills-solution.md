# Solution Summary for Issue #94: Claude Command Was Killed

## Changes Made

### 1. **Memory Check Before Claude Execution**
- Added `checkMemory()` function that checks available memory from `/proc/meminfo`
- Checks if available memory is at least 256MB before starting Claude
- Provides helpful Ubuntu 24.04 swap increase instructions if insufficient memory
- Called early in the process to prevent Claude from starting if memory is too low

### 2. **System Resource Monitoring**
- Added `getResourceSnapshot()` function to capture system state
- Takes resource snapshots before Claude execution and on failure
- Logs memory, CPU load, and uptime information
- Helps diagnose what caused Claude to be killed

### 3. **Improved Process Kill Detection**
- Enhanced stderr monitoring to detect kill signals (SIGKILL, SIGTERM, etc.)
- Added specific detection for memory-related kills (OOM, "killed", etc.)
- Provides detailed exit code explanations:
  - Exit code 137: SIGKILL (likely memory constraints)
  - Exit code 139: SIGSEGV (segmentation fault)  
  - Exit code 143: SIGTERM (terminated)

### 4. **Claude CLI Connection with Sonnet Model**
- Updated both `solve.mjs` and `hive.mjs` to use `--model sonnet` for connection checks
- This ensures connection tests use the cheapest model instead of potentially expensive default
- Changes made to all three connection check commands:
  - `printf hi | claude --model sonnet -p`
  - `timeout 60 claude --model sonnet -p hi`
  - Updated error message to suggest `claude --model sonnet -p hi`

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**
- Better resource monitoring on Claude command failure
- Improved error messages with specific kill detection
- Enhanced log attachment for failures when `--attach-logs` is used
- Added failure logs to PR comments when command fails

### 6. **Proper Error Codes**
- Ensure `process.exit(1)` is called on all failure scenarios
- Added proper error code handling in main catch block
- Maintain clean error propagation throughout the system

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by:
1. **Low memory**: System had only ~56MB available memory vs. 256MB+ needed for Claude
2. **Insufficient swap**: Only 512MB total swap, mostly used
3. **No early memory check**: Claude would start and then get killed by OOM killer
4. **Expensive connection checks**: Using default model for connection tests

## Testing

The solution was tested with:
- Memory check functionality at various thresholds
- Resource snapshot collection
- Error detection patterns
- Low memory scenario simulation

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Early Detection**: Memory issues detected before Claude starts
2. **Clear Instructions**: Users get specific Ubuntu 24.04 swap increase commands
3. **Better Diagnostics**: When Claude is killed, users see resource state and likely cause
4. **Cost Optimization**: Connection checks use cheapest sonnet model
5. **Proper Failure Handling**: Failures return appropriate exit codes and attach logs

The solution addresses all aspects mentioned in the GitHub issue while maintaining backward compatibility and improving the overall user experience when encountering resource constraints.
