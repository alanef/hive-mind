We need to make sure our code is the highest quality.

We need to ensure it adheres to:

- DRY principle
- SOLID principles
- The code is simple and easy to maintain
- We have maximum possible logging in --verbose mode
- All catch clauses use Sentry, so no errors or warnings are missed
- Function names are easy to understand and document what they doing
- All lib functions are documented with JS Doc
- And other best practices of today
