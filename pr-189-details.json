{"baseRefName":"main","body":"## Summary\n\nThis PR successfully reorganizes the codebase to ensure all `.mjs` files have no more than 1500 lines of code, as requested in issue #184.\n\n### ðŸ”§ Changes Made\n\n1. **Split solve.mjs into smaller modules using solve.*.lib.mjs naming convention:**\n   - `solve.config.lib.mjs` (101 lines) - CLI argument parsing\n   - `solve.validation.lib.mjs` (219 lines) - Input validation and system checks\n   - `solve.auto-continue.lib.mjs` (247 lines) - Auto-continue logic\n   - `solve.execution.lib.mjs` (223 lines) - Main execution helpers\n   - `solve.repository.lib.mjs` (323 lines) - Repository management functions\n   - `solve.results.lib.mjs` (329 lines) - Results processing functions\n   - `solve.claude-execution.lib.mjs` (283 lines) - Claude command execution and output processing\n   - `solve.feedback.lib.mjs` (309 lines) - Comment counting and feedback detection\n\n2. **Refactored main solve.mjs:**\n   - Reduced from 2830 lines to **1474 lines** âœ…\n   - Now imports and uses all the new modules\n   - All functionality preserved\n\n3. **Added GitHub Actions check:**\n   - New CI job `check-file-line-limits` that verifies all `.mjs` files are under 1500 lines\n   - Automatically runs on every PR that modifies `.mjs` files\n   - Fails the build if any file exceeds the limit\n\n4. **Updated package.json:**\n   - Added `solve.*.lib.mjs` pattern to the files list for npm package inclusion\n   - Ensures all library modules are included when the package is published\n\n### ðŸ“Š File Size Comparison\n\n| File | Before | After | Status |\n|------|--------|-------|--------|\n| solve.mjs | 2830 lines | 1474 lines | âœ… Under limit |\n| solve.config.lib.mjs | - | 101 lines | âœ… Under limit |\n| solve.validation.lib.mjs | - | 219 lines | âœ… Under limit |\n| solve.auto-continue.lib.mjs | - | 247 lines | âœ… Under limit |\n| solve.execution.lib.mjs | - | 223 lines | âœ… Under limit |\n| solve.repository.lib.mjs | - | 323 lines | âœ… Under limit |\n| solve.results.lib.mjs | - | 329 lines | âœ… Under limit |\n| solve.claude-execution.lib.mjs | - | 283 lines | âœ… Under limit |\n| solve.feedback.lib.mjs | - | 309 lines | âœ… Under limit |\n\n### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives Achieved\n\n- âœ… All `.mjs` files are now under 1500 lines\n- âœ… GitHub Actions check added to enforce the limit\n- âœ… Code is properly modularized with clean interfaces\n- âœ… File naming follows `solve.*.lib.mjs` convention as requested\n- âœ… Package.json updated to include all library files\n- âœ… All tests are passing\n- âœ… No functionality lost during refactoring\n\n### ðŸ§ª Test Plan\n\n- [x] All new modules compile without errors\n- [x] GitHub Actions check works correctly\n- [x] File line limits are enforced automatically\n- [x] solve.mjs still functions correctly with all modules\n- [x] CI tests pass\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Verify new modules are properly structured and under 1500 lines\n- [x] Confirm GitHub Actions check correctly identifies files over the limit\n- [x] Test that refactored solve.mjs still imports modules correctly\n- [x] Ensure all functionality works as before\n- [x] Verify package.json includes all solve.*.lib.mjs files\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n---\n\nResolves #184","headRefName":"issue-184-5f675129","mergeStateStatus":"CLEAN","number":189,"state":"OPEN","title":"Reorganize code to split files into modules under 1500 lines each"}
