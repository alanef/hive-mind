{"baseRefName":"main","body":"## Summary\n\nThis PR fixes critical undefined variable errors that were causing the solve command to not work properly, and adds ESLint configuration to prevent such issues in the future.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe issue was caused by several undefined variable references in the code:\n1. **solve.mjs (lines 1448-1483)**: Error handling code was orphaned outside of the catch block, referencing an undefined 'error' variable\n2. **solve.execution.lib.mjs & solve.results.lib.mjs**: Functions using 'argv.verbose' without argv being passed as parameter\n3. **solve.mjs (line 1484)**: 'limitReached' variable used in finally block but only defined inside try block\n4. **solve.results.lib.mjs**: Missing 'shouldAttachLogs' parameter and 'cleanErrorMessage' import\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- âœ… Fixed undefined 'error' variable by properly wrapping error handling in catch block\n- âœ… Fixed undefined 'argv' parameter in handleExecutionError functions\n- âœ… Fixed undefined 'limitReached' variable by declaring it before try block\n- âœ… Fixed undefined 'shouldAttachLogs' parameter in showSessionSummary\n- âœ… Fixed missing 'cleanErrorMessage' import in solve.results.lib.mjs\n\n### Code Quality Improvements\n- âœ… Added ESLint configuration (.eslintrc.json) with strict undefined variable checks\n- âœ… Added ESLint as dev dependency with lint scripts in package.json\n- âœ… Auto-fixed quote style inconsistencies across all files\n- âœ… Fixed unnecessary escape characters in regex patterns\n\n## Testing\n\n- âœ… Both  and  work correctly\n- âœ… ESLint now catches undefined variable errors: reduced from 51 to 44 issues (9 errors, 35 warnings)\n- âœ… All critical 'no-undef' errors have been resolved\n- âœ… Created test script in experiments/test-undefined-vars.mjs to check for issues\n\n## Files Changed\n\n-  - New ESLint configuration\n-  - Added ESLint dependency and lint scripts\n-  - Fixed critical undefined variable errors\n-  - Added argv parameter with default\n-  - Fixed missing parameters and imports\n- Multiple  files - Quote style consistency fixes via ESLint auto-fix\n\nFixes #204\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>","commits":[{"authoredDate":"2025-09-19T13:21:12Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"}],"committedDate":"2025-09-19T13:21:12Z","messageBody":"Adding CLAUDE.md with task information for AI processing.\nThis file will be removed when the task is complete.\n\nIssue: https://github.com/deep-assistant/hive-mind/issues/204","messageHeadline":"Initial commit with task details for issue #204","oid":"ab0a82609e0a06b1d39e47c853199c09603448c5"},{"authoredDate":"2025-09-19T13:34:15Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"}],"committedDate":"2025-09-19T13:34:15Z","messageBody":"- Fixed undefined 'error' variable in solve.mjs catch block (lines 1448-1483)\n- Fixed undefined 'argv' parameter in handleExecutionError functions\n- Fixed undefined 'limitReached' variable in finally block\n- Fixed undefined 'shouldAttachLogs' parameter in showSessionSummary\n- Fixed undefined 'cleanErrorMessage' import in solve.results.lib.mjs\n- Added ESLint configuration to prevent undefined variable errors\n- Added ESLint as dev dependency with npm scripts for linting\n- Auto-fixed quote style issues across all files for consistency\n- Both hive.mjs and solve.mjs now work correctly\n\nThis resolves issue #204 where the solve command was not working due to\nundefined variable references that would cause runtime errors.","messageHeadline":"Fix critical undefined variable errors and add ESLint configuration","oid":"48e34b26430919112c91a05680cf8b6d24d63a28"},{"authoredDate":"2025-09-19T13:35:32Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"}],"committedDate":"2025-09-19T13:35:32Z","messageBody":"","messageHeadline":"Remove CLAUDE.md -
