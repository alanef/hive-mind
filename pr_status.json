{"body":"## Summary\n\nThis PR implements support for passing the `--auto-continue` option from the `hive` command down to `solve.mjs`, addressing issue #272.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n- âœ… Added `--auto-continue` option to hive.mjs yargs configuration\n- âœ… Pass the option to solve.mjs when spawning worker processes\n- âœ… Display auto-continue status in monitoring configuration output\n- âœ… Added unit test to verify the implementation\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nThe `--auto-continue` option allows the hive command to automatically continue with existing PRs for issues if they are older than 24 hours. This option is now properly passed down to solve.mjs when processing issues.\n\n### Key changes in `src/hive.mjs`:\n1. Added the option definition in the yargs configuration\n2. Added logic to push `--auto-continue` to the arguments array when spawning solve.mjs\n3. Added status display when auto-continue is enabled\n4. Included the flag in command logging for transparency\n\n## Test Plan\n\n- [x] Created unit test (`tests/test-hive-auto-continue.mjs`) that verifies:\n  - The option is properly defined in yargs configuration\n  - The flag is correctly passed to solve.mjs\n  - The flag variable is properly defined\n  - The flag is included in command logging\n  - Auto-continue status is displayed in monitoring output\n- [x] All unit tests pass successfully\n- [x] Verified the option appears in `--help` output\n\n## How to Use\n\n```bash\n# Enable auto-continue when running hive\nhive https://github.com/owner/repo --auto-continue\n```\n\nWhen enabled, the monitoring output will show:\n```\nðŸ”„ Auto-Continue: ENABLED (will continue with existing PRs older than 24 hours)\n```\n\nFixes #272\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOPUU0qc7F5_Vi","author":{"login":"konard"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"## ðŸ¤– Solution Draft Log\n\nThis log file contains the complete execution trace of the AI solution draft process.\n\nðŸ“Ž **Log file uploaded as GitHub Gist** (196KB)\nðŸ”— [View complete solution draft log](https://gist.github.com/konard/4c9aff88cc8c16475504937529a72daa)\n\n---\n*Log automatically attached by solve.mjs with --attach-logs option*","createdAt":"2025-09-22T17:22:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/deep-assistant/hive-mind/pull/274#issuecomment-3320313186","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOPUU0qc7F6wBV","author":{"login":"konard"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"``` will continue with existing PRs older than 24 hours) ```\r\n\r\nIt is not clear enough.\r\n\r\nWe should write something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwill working on issues with existing PRs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck also other places, and in that case we should not --skip-issues-with-prs (or throw an error, that --skip-issues-with-prs and --auto-continue options are in the conflict).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?
