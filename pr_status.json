{"body":"## Summary\n\nThis PR addresses issue #262 by changing the default behavior of handling uncommitted changes after Claude finishes execution. Previously, any uncommitted changes were automatically committed and pushed, which could lead to unwanted files being committed (e.g., `venv/` folders with 300+ files).\n\n## Changes\n\n1. **Disabled auto-commit by default**: The tool no longer automatically commits uncommitted changes\n2. **Added `--auto-commit-uncommitted-changes` option**: Users can opt-in to the previous behavior with this new flag\n3. **Improved feedback for uncommitted changes**: When auto-commit is disabled, the tool:\n   - Shows clear instructions for manual commit/push\n   - Includes uncommitted changes as feedback when running Claude again\n\n## Testing\n\n- Added test script in `experiments/test_auto_commit_option.sh` to verify the new option\n- All existing tests remain unaffected\n- The option appears correctly in help output with proper description\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Better control**: Users decide what gets committed to their repository\n- **Prevents accidents**: No more unintended commits of large folders or sensitive files\n- **Preserves flexibility**: The old behavior is still available via the option flag\n- **Improved workflow**: Uncommitted changes are shown as feedback, helping Claude understand the current state\n\n## Usage\n\n**Default behavior (auto-commit disabled):**\n```bash\n./src/solve.mjs https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123\n# Uncommitted changes will be shown but not committed\n```\n\n**With auto-commit enabled:**\n```bash\n./src/solve.mjs https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123 --auto-commit-uncommitted-changes\n# Uncommitted changes will be automatically committed and pushed\n```\n\nFixes #262\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOPUU0qc7FpJ4a","author":{"login":"konard"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"## ðŸ¤– Solution Draft Log\n\nThis log file contains the complete execution trace of the AI solution draft process.\n\nðŸ“Ž **Log file uploaded as GitHub Gist** (217KB)\nðŸ”— [View complete solution draft log](https://gist.github.com/konard/fb3d4d8d5b793ed70cb5f4b24344fdac)\n\n---\n*Log automatically attached by solve.mjs with --attach-logs option*","createdAt":"2025-09-21T10:20:23Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/deep-assistant/hive-mind/pull/264#issuecomment-3315899930","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOPUU0qc7FpKgK","author":{"login":"konard"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Changes are good, but not enough.
