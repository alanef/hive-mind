{"baseRefName":"main","body":"## 🐛 Issue Fixed\n\nFixes #235 - Streaming of solve commands stopped working in hive command\n\n## 📋 Problem\n\nThe hive command was not streaming output from solve commands in real-time. Instead, it would wait for the entire solve process to complete before showing any output. This issue was particularly problematic as shown in PR #232 where no output was displayed during Claude command execution.\n\n## 🔍 Root Cause\n\nThe streaming output handlers in `hive.mjs` were configured with `{ verbose: true }`, which meant the output was only visible when the `--verbose` flag was used. This was an unintended restriction that broke the expected streaming behavior for normal users.\n\n## ✅ Solution\n\nRemoved the `{ verbose: true }` option from the streaming log calls in `hive.mjs`:\n- Line 572: stdout streaming handler\n- Line 582: stderr streaming handler  \n- Line 596: error handler\n\nNow the streaming output is always visible in real-time, regardless of the verbose flag setting.\n\n## 🧪 Testing\n\nAdded comprehensive test script `experiments/test-hive-streaming-fix.mjs` that:\n- Verifies streaming works without the verbose flag\n- Tests both stdout and stderr streaming\n- Confirms real-time output display\n- Validates the fix resolves issue #235\n\nThe test confirms that output is now streamed in real-time as expected.\n\n## 📝 Changes\n\n- Modified `src/hive.mjs` to remove verbose flag requirements\n- Added test script to verify the fix\n\n---\n*This PR was created automatically by the AI issue solver*","headRefName":"issue-235-737cfb20","isDraft":false,"mergeStateStatus":"UNSTABLE","mergeable":"MERGEABLE","state":"OPEN","title":"fix: Streaming of solve commands stopped working in hive command","url":"https://github.com/deep-assistant/hive-mind/pull/236"}
